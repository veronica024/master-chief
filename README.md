In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).
Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)
Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 
Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.
Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.

Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!
NOTES
OPTIONAL: To thin out the sauce, add a couple tablespoons of ghee or butter at the end of cooking, and gently simmer it through. Alternatively, add a small amount of water.

5 starsThank you so much for this recipe. I didn’t have all the right ingredients (yogurt, fenugreek, sufficient cream) but it turned out amazingly well, at least to me! There have been other recipes but this one is best 🙂 Maybe next time instead of mincing the ginger I may make a garlic ginger paste either with a spice blender or a mortar and pestle, but it’s a lovely flavor the fresh ginger and really comes through. Also, will try to have enough heavy cream (had to use a mixture of cream, sour cream, and half and half) on hand.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they did turn out very tender even with all the cooking. Wonder what it is about the marinade that makes it so?

I plan to freeze some of the sauce for the next batch of chicken!

Happy cooking

I made this for my picky and varied family tonight. I’m Canadian, my husband is Jamaican (also a chef), 3 kids (ages 20, 12 and 3). I’m using things from my freezer so used a whole chicken, chopped, since I have several on hand. I didn’t have fenugreek. Also didn’t have heavy cream so I used evaporated milk. I used about half of the chili powder so it would have a little kick but not too much spice for my 3 year old. WOE!!! Served with toasted garlic bread. This was soooooo delicious! Every family member loved it.

5 starsabsolutely love this recipe. I did a couple things different though:
1. I used crushed tomatoes instead of what the recipe calls for. This let me skip the whole blender thing.
2. I cooked the chicken in much bigger groups (7-10 pieces at a time) on low heat, with vegetable oil. The olive oil kept burning and it was just frustrating. I also popped the lid on the pan for a minute or too to help it cook more evenly.

I’m still pretty new to cooking so I’m sure these things were not in the recipe for a reason, but it still tasted amazing and my family of picky eaters (I’m a teenager, it’s my mom who’s picky lol) loves it so much.

Eurika, You can use 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh celery leaves per 1 tsp of the kasoori methi/fenugreek leaves. Or you can add a big dash of maple syrup but this would be added very near the end because the aroma cooks off quickly.

5 starsI have to say a HUGE thank you for this recipe – I’m not a particularly confident cook, nor am I a fan of (hot spicy) Indian food so it’s not something I’ve ever attempted to make for myself.

The current situation of being isolated and staying home means I’ve had more time to cook and with today being my birthday I decided I’d make the effort to do something different. I had most of the ingredients already, just needed to find turmeric and double cream and I used crème fraiche instead of yoghurt. Hand on heart, I didn’t have high hopes of it turning out well but honestly I’m delighted that it was not only easy but absolutely delicious and I am definitely going to make it again after all this is over. Thanks again for helping to make my birthday a bit better 🙂

My husband very rarely makes dinner requests, he usually eats whatever I cook. This is the only recipe he will specifically ask for in the last few months. I make it exactly as listed except once I used coconut milk ( it was slightly sweeter) and once when I made it for myself I used lamb (hubby was out of town). It tastes very authentic. There is an Asian market about 10 miles from my house so I get my ghee, masala and methi powder there. You can get the methi powder on Ebay and Amazon also, I think it is worth it, it tastes more authentic.

Hey , thanks for the recipe. Turned out effing amazing.

My touches:
– x1 the chicken dark meat from tight and legs; much more tender than chicken breast
– x1/2 the amount of red chili ; mild enough for my kid but distant hot flavor definitely there
– x4 the amount of yogurt; meat extra coated with thick marinade cooks wonderful in the skillet
– x2 all the other ingredients except salt

Served with brown basmati rice (22 min cooking time in the Instant Pot + 10min natural pressure release)

It’s a killer.

I cookd chicken breast fillets often (cut to bite size pieces) and it requires very little cooking…..nothing worse than dry overcooked chicken. 😉

Seems key to the success was a good patient sear on the chicken pieces, a patient simmer of the tomatoes and a complete scraping of the stuck brown bits from the bottom of the pot. I also substituted the recommended evaporated milk for cream to save calories and it was still lush. Could not stop sliding the Naan through the sauce.

Hello Karina,

I made this recipe three times within the span of one month. Twice with chicken, and once with Aussie lamb meat (third time). Each time it was perfect and my family loved it. For the lamb, I used shoulder meat, boneless. I also adjusted the simmering time. Absolutely out of this world.

Took your advice the second time by making extra sauce that I used with the lamb meat.

I love your recipes because they are clear and simple, yet very detailed. Delicious!! Anyone that has a little motivation can make them.

Next time I make it I do plan on using less salt. We found that the 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in the sauce is too much. I think next time I will just start with 1/2 teaspoon. Otherwise, the texture of the sauce is amazing, I love the idea of blending it all up. The leftovers are good too!

Like everyone has commented, this recipe is hands down the best Butter Chicken we’ve tasted including from many Indian restaurants. My son made Raita, I made a Nan bread, my wife made the chicken, basmati and vegetables on the side. We were all very happy and extremely full!

5 starsGreat recipe. Especially when made ahead and ate the next day! I added more passata and doubled the spices for 900g of chicken thighs. Marinaded overnight. After browning the chicken I put it in a slow cooker, made the sauce and put it in a blender and added it to the slow cooker and let the chicken cook on high for 4 hours for it to simmer and really get juicy. Chicken was so tender and delicious. Loved it. Definately adding this recipe to my cookbook 🙂 thanks!

I’ve got my sauce made ( used lite coconut milk). Chicken marinading overnight.
Planned to cook in crockpot tomorrow like someone suggested. Will there be a problem with my coconut milk separating during the long slow cooking?

5 starsA huge winner! I have made this several times now (I have to even make double batches now!) and my family absolutely adores it. My two siblings are quite fussy but even they prefer this over the ones we buy from the local Indian restaurants. The spices gives it a flavoursome, authentic taste, rather than that Americanised creamy flavour.
10/10 recommend.
The only adjustments I make is adding more ginger and garlic as I absolutely love the hell out of it! I also add a dab less cream, and more chilli

5 starsI have made several versions of Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala over the past couple of years, and just always felt like something was missing, or wasn’t completely happy with it. Well those days are over…. this was delicious! Rather than my normal Kroger garam masala, I used Penzey’s this time and I think the good quality spices combined with this amazing recipe made all the difference! Thanks so much!

Your recipe was easy to follow and it turned out perfect. Today is the second time making it and I have to double the recipe, because my family loves it so much!

5 starsI had to comment! I have been making this recipe for months and everyone raves about it! Only thing I do different is I par-bake my chicken in the oven to give it some char, then add to the sauce to allow it to fully cook. It’s adds a slightly smoky flavor as if it’s been cooked in a tandoor. I skip the sugar and add fresh lemon juice to cut the tomato acid at the very end. Total hit!

5 starsI have made this recipe 6 times now, 4 times exactly as written, no substitutions or adjustments, and 2 times with slight variations to see if I could get away without marinating the chicken, or use ground ginger instead of fresh (as I don’t always have fresh ginger on hand). I have to say the original recipe without any changes is absolutely the best butter chicken I have ever had, either in Canada or in the UK. I have tried probably a dozen different recipes and most are fairly similar but this one is the keeper and my one and only “go-to” now. It is SO worth the time and effort involved. I would say definitely do NOT skip the marinating step. It really elevates the chicken in this dish so it marries perfectly with the sauce and the whole dish is incredible. If you skip the marinade, don’t bother with chicken and just make the sauce to have over veggies/rice. The chicken will be tasteless and disappointing compared to the amazingly flavourful, rich sauce. Secondly, you CAN get away with using ground ginger for convenience instead of fresh and it will still taste “good”…but the sauce will lack “zing” that makes you say “wow” with every bite. Use ground ginger if necessary for the marinade, but when it comes to the sauce, stick with fresh ginger for the wow factor. Seriously, the recipe is PERFECT as it is. Thank you, Karina, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

5 starsConfession: I am not a fan of Indian food. Unfortunately, hubby spent six weeks in India and it’s his favorite, lol. I determined that I could at least give it a shot, and after a “meh” crockpot recipe, decided to try this next. Hubby was basically giddy, lol. It is his FAVORITE food in the WHOLE WORLD, and the look of dazed bliss on his face made it worth making a recipe that forces me to use my blender, which would ordinarily be a deal breaker. I actually enjoyed it as well! Thanks so much for the recipe!

5 starsI did this without blending (i only read and bought ingredients, almost panicked when i got to the blending part of the recipe) and it still came out good. I even had to lessen the ginger and chili powder (housemates dont like ginger and spicy food) and it was a success. Ate this with basmati rice, which happened to be my fave rice, and it was a good meal!

This is by far the best butter chicken recipe…thank you VERY much!! You are a life saver!!!

PS, i felt like a spanish conquistador looking for spices xD…I drove to an Indian grocery store just for the Kasoori Methi, even if it was far from the grocery store where i bought the other ingredients. It was all worth it though. Again, thank you very much

5 starsOutstanding butter chicken recipe right here – so delicious and tastes the closest to ones I’ve had from South Asian restaurants. Because we like lots of leftovers, I added more boneless skinless thighs than what was called for and doubled the marinade ingredients, and had it marinating for a couple of days. I did not double the sauce ingredients but did use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of 14 oz. It turned out perfect – chicken so tender and flavourful and sauce so smooth and so good with naan bread and basmati rice. This will be my to go butter chicken recipe from now on.
